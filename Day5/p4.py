Problem Statement:

An online examination system maintains a question bank for
conducting competitive examinations.

Instead of loading all questions at once, the examination
system generates one question at a time whenever a student
moves to the next question.

Design a generator function to generate questions one by one.

If the number of questions is less than or equal to zero,
display:

Invalid Number of Questions

Requirements:
1. Use a generator function.
2. Use the yield statement.
3. Generate one question at a time.
4. Display the question number along with the question.
5. Validate the number of questions.

Input Format:
First line contains the number of questions.

Next N lines contain the question statements.

Output Format:
Display each generated question with its question number.

If the number of questions is invalid, display:

Invalid Number of Questions

Sample Input 1:
